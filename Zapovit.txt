Git is a open-source code managemen tool; it was created by Linus Torvalds when he was building the Linux kernel. 
Because of those roots, it needed to be really fast; that it is, and easy to get the hang of as well. 
Git allows you to work on your code with the peace of mind that everything you do is reversible. 
It makes it easy to experiment with new ideas in a project and not worry about breaking anything. 
The Git Parable, by Tom Preston-Werner, is a great introduction to the terms and ideas behind Git.
